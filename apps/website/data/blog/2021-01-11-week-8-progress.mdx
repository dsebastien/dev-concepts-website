I've missed the update yesterday, but I'm playing catch up today!

So, last week I dived back into the book and continued working on part 1. I would've liked to reach 75 or even 80%, but I'm at 70%. Not bad considering that I added a few more sections along the way.

That's the thing with plans; those are nice, but often incomplete. While writing, I think about many more things to write about, and also find many ideas during my weekly RSS-feeds review sessions.

Last week, I also wrote an article that caught A LOT of attention (~45K views after a week): https://medium.com/swlh/20-months-in-2k-hours-spent-and-200k-lost-a-story-about-resilience-and-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-69fd4f61ef59

Thanks to that article, I got a 100+ new followers on Medium alone, and (no kidding), a 4869% visits increase to the DevConcepts book landing page! Incredible ;-)

The article actually stayed on the front page of HackerNews for 10+ hours, which indeed has had a huge impact.

In addition, I got one more pre-order on Gumroad, which I'm really glad about. I hoped to get a few more, but every step counts, right?
