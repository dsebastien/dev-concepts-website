## Background
When I decided to work on Dev Concepts, I was thinking of writing a single book about IT and Software Development, explaining as many concepts as possible in a single sentence. I quickly changed my mind though and ended up planning a daunting 12-books collection covering the major subdomains of IT, including coding, best practices, team, project and product management.

The thing is that it has turned into an enormous project that will literally take me years to complete. I could take shortcuts, but I've come to realize that I don't want to. Dev Concepts is a passion project, but certainly not one I want to rush just to yield money. Instead, I want to create something to share with the field. Something I'll be proud of. Something timeless.

Since I've been so busy with [Personal Knowledge Management](https://obsidianstarterkit.com/), I haven't made progress on the books in the last few months, but I've continued collecting useful resources each week.

## Introducing the IT Concepts Wall
As I explore Hacker News, DEV.to and other sources, I keep stumbling upon ideas and concepts I want to cover in my books. Ultimately, these resources will serve as inspiration for me to turn the Dev Concepts series into a treasure trove of knowledge about the field.

But today, I've realized that the Trello board I use to collect all those resources is actually quite valuable. It now contains thousands of resources from sources I trust. So, in the spirit of solopreneurship, I've decided to turn that collection of resources into [an info product](https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/it-concepts-wall). Hopefully, this will enable more people enthusiastic about IT and software development to make progress towards their goals.

I launched this without crazy ambitions. It's a simple list of resources. It's not perfect. It's not magic. But I'm sure it can help newcomers and experts alike to learn new things.

If you're curious about this new project, then go check out the product page on Gumroad: https://developassion.gumroad.com/l/it-concepts-wall
