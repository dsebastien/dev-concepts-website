Hello there!

Quick update today about the project. This past week, I've continued working on the second volume. I'm almost done proofreading it, finally.

The funeral of our relative was yesterday, and it's been really hard on us. Covid doesn't make things easy; everything feels so surreal...

If all goes well, I should be able to publish the second volume on Tuesday. As soon as it is done, I'll get back to writing the third volume about Architecture.

The whole project is running late, but I don't want to put needless pressure on myself. Life is hard enough as it is with Covid. I think that I'll stop worrying about the deadline, and just focus on delivering quality content. It'll be there when it's done (just like Blizzard games).

The landing page is getting visitors from all over the world, it's pretty cool. This week there were 53 visits, and I sold one copy of the first volume. It's not much, but more than enough to make me happy.

That's it for today!
