This week, I've finished the draft outline of the book, and I've published the (really) short version on the product page: https://gumroad.com/l/DevConcepts

There are now 12 parts in total, which I intend to sell separately (5-25$ each), covering quite a broad spectrum. I'll also create "bundles" with a small price drop.

I've started estimating the page count for each of the parts, but I'm not done yet. I still have four parts to estimate. That takes a lot of time as I'm going through the mindmap and thinking about the "space" I'll need for each section.

It's the kind of exercise that I find really tiresome, but that'll help me a lot during the project. First of all, it'll serve as a reference but more immediately, it'll help me figure out the price tag for each part. For instance, part 1 about software craft should be ~50 pages long, while part 6 (coding basics) should be ~160 pages long, hence their price will be different. Going through the plan again also helps me correct minor mistakes and align everything.

Next week, I'll publish the long version of the outline on the landing page (actually a dedicated page) and I'll update the options/prices of the product page on Gumroad. Until then, if I get any pre-orders, then those will benefit from the current price, which is definitely to be higher afterward :p

Once that is done, I'll start writing part 1, covering everything one should know about software craft.
