Hello everyone, SÃ©bastien here ðŸ‘‹

I hope you're all having fun and learning a lot. I'm still taking some time off to take care of my newborn son, but don't worry, I'll soon be back!

Meanwhile, don't miss the [deal that I've launched on AppSumo](https://appsumo.com/products/dev-concepts-starter-edition/).

With that deal, you can get your hands âœ‹ on the first two books of the Dev Concepts collection at a lower price ($15). In addition, you'll also get access to our software crafters community.

I'm excited to be able to share this deal with you. I hope that you'll seize this chance to explore the software crafts and what clients really desire. Importantly, this supports my work and allows me to keep writing books! ðŸš€

See you soon!
