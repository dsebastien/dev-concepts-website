Whew, I'm late!
Apparently, stay-cation days pass faster than I had imagined!

It's been pretty hectic at home these last few days, with schools closed and kids at home. But we're alive.

No new sales recently, but I noticed a steady increase of visitors to the landing page: 87 this past week (+155%), but with 16 seconds of average engagement time (ouch!). I did try to improve the landing page a bit, but I'm still poking in the dark on that front.

I've also decided to rename "Tomes" to "Volumes", in the hope that it makes things clearer regarding the content. We'll see if that helps.

Since the last update, I've decided to focus on publishing the second volume. It was supposed to go live tomorrow, but I most probably won't make the deadline. Unfortunately, life happens. We've lost a loved one, which took my attention very far away from this project... I'm playing catch up, but I don't want to rush things needlessly.

My goal in the coming week is to make sure that I deliver the second volume, and then to get back to writing the third one.

That's it for today!
