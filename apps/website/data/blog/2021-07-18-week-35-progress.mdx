Hello there!

What a week this has been! I'm still in shock from everything that has happened here in Belgium and in the rest of Europe.

Friends and family members have been hit really hard by the floods, and the level of damage is astounding.

We're lucky enough to live in an area that was spared, but there were many villages all around that have been devastated.

I suppose that it's the kind of extreme weather events that we'll need to "get used to" with global warming, and this is really scary...

I wasn't very focused on Dev Concepts this week, unfortunately. I'll resume my efforts next week...

Take care and see you all very soon!
