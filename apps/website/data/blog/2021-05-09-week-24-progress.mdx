Hello there!

I have exciting news to share today: I'm going to be a dad for the third time later this year. It's the best news ever for our family, especially in these troubled times.

Now back to Dev Concepts ;-)

This week has gone with the wind. I've only managed to free up two hours to write and dedicated those to finishing the section about microservices. Microservices are cool, but they're often overused and misused, probably because of all the hype.

That's why I ended up writing 7 pages instead of the 3 I estimated initially, in order to not only explain the concepts, but also the pros and cons. BTW if you're curious, I've published a super-condensed list of cons here: https://twitter.com/dSebastien/status/1390693510341447688

Regarding the numbers: no new copies sold this week, and around ~30 visits.

Next week, I'll continue working on volume 3 of course. I'll be writing about cloud-native apps, serverless architectures and CQRS, one of my favorite architectural patterns.

That's it for today!
