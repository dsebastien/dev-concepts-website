Hello there!

I'm still lost in the pit of uncertainty with this project, and I'm feeling down this week. It's been pretty tough recently, and things are still complicated at home, for various reasons. I'm also under the impression that my other project (SaaS startup) isn't going anywhere, and it's hard to cope with failure.

So far, I've spent ~273 hours on Dev Concepts, and am around 20% done. What's demotivating is realizing that I still struggle to gain any traction. It's really a journey through the desert, all alone, with little to no water =)

There were ~40 visitors on the landing page this week, but none converted; bummer.

I also gave away a few copies of the first volume in exchange for feedback, but so far I didn't get much back. It feels a bit disappointing, but I understand that people have other things to do.. :)

Anyways, I have to keep going, the road ahead is still long.

This week, I've continued working on Volume 3 (Architecture). I wrote about cloud-native applications and the famous 12 factors. I find those really worth knowing about, so I'm spending a bit more time articulating them clearly, along with their pros and cons.

That's it for today!
