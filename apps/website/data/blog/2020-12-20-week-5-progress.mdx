This week, I've spent 8 hours writing the introduction of the book and I've started working on the first part, which is dedicated to the software craft.

It took me quite a while to write the introduction (at least 3 hours), probably because there was so much I wanted to say and didn't find my words :)

On one end there's the motivation that I wanted to share with readers, especially the junior ones. On the other, I wanted to explain my own journey a bit; both to remember and to be humble (the delta between what I know and what I'd like to know is and will always be so huge :p).

I've also explained what software development means to me, and how I differentiate that from software engineering. Without being pedantic, I think that there's really a difference, mainly in terms of approach.

I also wrote about career evolution for software developers and tried to convey the idea that there are so many options/possibilities ahead, depending on motivation and personal preference.

Finally, I've started writing about the software craft. I've explained what it is about and why I think that it's important to consider, whether the reader is a junior or an expert in the field.

Next up, I'll explain all the important skills that a software crafter should have (or try to acquire over time) and I'll give as much advice as I can, based on my personal experience.

I don't think that I've mentioned it before, but I've got my first pre-orders for the book, which is really wonderful!

The Website doesn't drive too much attention yet (~70 visitors in the last week), but I guess that it's to be expected at this stage. I'm not pushing too hard to drive people to the Website. Maybe I should, maybe not.

I'm a bit reluctant to push hard at this point because I haven't written much yet and I'm a bit anxious at the idea of having many pre-orders and a lot of pressure to deliver ;-)

I'm curious to have everyone's opinion about this.

Next week, I'll keep on working on the first part; there's still a lot of work ahead. I think that I'm 10-15% done with this first part.

That's it for today! :)
