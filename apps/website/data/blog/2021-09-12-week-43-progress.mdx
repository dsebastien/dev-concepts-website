Hello everyone!

I hope you all had a great week!
I wish I could say I did, but stress levels are extreme on my end. My wife could finally get back home, but she can barely walk so it's still very complicated at home.

## Progress
I wish I could tell you that I made progress this week, but the energy simply wasn't there. With the stress and the preparations for the baby, I can't dedicate nearly as much time to this project as I'd like to.

The only thing I managed to do this week was publishing one more article taken out of the first volume: https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-09-11-problem-solving-101

## Marketing & Sales
I'll meet Claire again next week to discuss for the landing page review. I have high hopes on that front! :)

This past week, there were ~35 visitors on the landing page. The main sources are: dev.to, indiehackers.com, Google, my blog, and Twitter.

Country wise, visitors were from various parts of the globe: Indie on top, then Netherlands, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Sweden, Canada, United States of America, etc

No new sales this week.

## What's next
Once the baby is born (i.e., real soon), I will take some time off to be present and welcome this wonderful new person in our family ;-)

Hopefully once I have had time to recharge a bit, I'll get back to Dev Concepts and will continue writing.

So again, no empty promises. I prefer to push back the release date of Volume 3 than rush it and deliver low-quality content.

Have a great week!
