I've posted a write-up to explain my progress in the past week: https://www.indiehackers.com/post/devconcepts-book-journey-week-1-1b9fba3330

Soon after publishing it though, I've discovered the "product" part of IndieHackers. So from now on, I'll instead publish the status updates here.

The good news is that I'm in the starting blocks to start writing. I've created my book template and that's a GOOD step :)

The next big milestone for me is the preparation of the book's table of contents, which I'm working on right now.
