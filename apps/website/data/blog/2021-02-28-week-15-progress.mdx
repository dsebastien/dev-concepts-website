Hey there!

This week I've felt exhausted each and every day. On Tuesday & Thursday, I just couldn't find any motivation to write. As you can guess it means that I didn't progress all that much this week. It's just a little bump in the road though; nothing to worry about ;-)

Yesterday, I got back to it and prepared the example that will serve as the backbone for the architectural patterns. I've also started the section about patterns and will focus on those next week.

Today, I'm not feeling well either. I need to recharge my batteries, and get ready to make next week a blast!

I know this is disappointing if you're eager to receive your copy of the book, but don't worry. According to my plans, I'm still ~30 hours ahead of my schedule, so it should be okay. I put in more efforts in the last weeks, which is probably why I'm so tired now.

This week there were 34 visits on the landing page; still almost like a flat line :p. What's more worrying for me is the fact that I only a single pre-order this week, even though I posted a few times about the end of the early-bird price. This can mean two things: either nobody cares yet because the release date is still far in the future, or the content is not interesting/appealing enough. I hope it's the former...

I'm thinking more and more about already selling the first part of the book separately, just to see if it brings more eyeballs on this project, and if that can actually be sold on its own.

That's it for today!
