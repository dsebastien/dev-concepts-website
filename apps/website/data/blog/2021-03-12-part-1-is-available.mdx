The big news that I want to share today is that part 1 is now available for sale. It took me a while to proofread it and make sure that the content is awesome.

Part 1 is dedicated to the Software Craft. It explains tons and tons about what it means to be a Software Crafter, and how to become one. It won't teach you how to code, but it'll tell you everything about where to start, how to think, and how to act.

You can buy this part on Gumroad: https://gum.co/DevConcepts-Part-01-SoftwareCraft

If you want to later buy another edition of Dev Concepts, don't worry; I'll make sure that you don't pay twice for the same content.

If you get your copy, then don't hesitate to contact me and give me feedback about it. I want to make Dev Concepts as good as possible, and feedback is invaluable!
