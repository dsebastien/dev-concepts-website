Hello there!

This week I've completed the section about the 12 factors. It took me a while, but there are really some important points in there that I needed to make.

I've also published an in-depth article about Angular 12 last week, which is an interesting read for anyone interested in front-end software development. It shows how fast things move on that front: https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-05-13-angular-12-in-depth

By the way, in case you didn't know, I regularly send a newsletter about software development: https://mailchi.mp/fb661753d54a/developassion-newsletter

Also, I don't know if I've shared this here already, but I maintain a public Trello board with ideas of things to cover in the Dev Concepts series: https://trello.com/b/4oK5lsD1/dev-concepts-ideas

And that's only the tip of the iceberg. When I started the project, I prepared the outline by creating a detailed mindmap about the contents. I've shared it with a number of colleagues/friends working in software development (back & front), IT security, IT infrastructure, and database management. The nice thing about that is that they all gave me ideas about some things I forgot to add/didn't think of. Here's how it looked back in November of last year: https://twitter.com/dSebastien/status/1330538772908412930.

Since then, it has grown A LOT. If there's interest, then I'll publish it. I think it will be a valuable resource in and of itself.

At some point I'll also introduce a way for you to easily send me ideas about concepts that ought to be covered. For now, the easiest is to contact me through Twitter or by e-mail.

Of course the more topics I have to cover, the longer it will take me to deliver the whole series. But it'll help me to give a broader picture of the IT landscape for everyone. From my experience, far too few people have actually a sufficient understanding of different IT domains, which limits their horizons.

On other news, there were 55 visits on the landing page, which is a nice improvement over last week. Sadly, 0 new sales this week.

Next week, I'll be writing about Serverless architectures; another deeply interesting subject.

That's it for today!
Have a great week :)
