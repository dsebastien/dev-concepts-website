Hello there!

This week I've finished writing the section about serverless computing. I initially planned 3 pages, and ended up writing 10+ ;-)

There were only 25 visits this week, so definitely not going great. There were no new sales either. I'm clearly in need of advice for marketing & sales but haven't found people I can ask for help just yet...

Anyways, I'm continuing work on volume 3 about architecture. Once that one is ready, I'll try a few more things to promote the content. The road is long and dark ;-))

On Twitter, I've unfollowed a gazillion people because I was growing tired of Twitter's limitations (I was capped at 5K), and started adding everyone into lists: https://twitter.com/dSebastien/lists. This may be useful to others, so I'll probably mention it in the first volume. Personally, following great people on Twitter has always helped me discover cool new things, and stay up to date with upcoming trends.

Next week, I'll be writing about CQRS and Event-Driven Architectures (EDA), two very interesting subjects. Can't wait to deliver these :)

That's it for today!
