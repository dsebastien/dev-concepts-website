Hey there!

This past week, I've finished part 2, which felt GREAT.

I'm pretty glad about how it turned out, and can't wait to put it out there. It's only the first draft, so I'll later need to proofread it and improve it further, but finishing the first draft is always motivating.

Two parts done, ten to go! Yay!

I've updated the table of contents to reflect the final content of part 2: https://dev-concepts.dev/table-of-contents/#what-clients-need. It ended up being 50 pages long instead of the 35 that I initially estimated!

Yesterday, I've started writing the third part, which is all about Architecture; one of my favorite subjects. If you're curious, here's the high-level content that it should cover: https://dev-concepts.dev/table-of-contents/#architecture. As usual, this is only a glimpse of what the chapter will contain; I've estimated that part to become 70 pages long, but it will probably expand and reach 80-100 pages. This is going to be FUN.

The early-bird promotion for the book will be gone in 14 days, but so far I only got a handful of pre-orders. It's still very hard to gain traction.

This week, I got 56 visits on the landing page, up 125% from last week. Unfortunately, no pre-orders this week either; so I either don't attack the right audience, or my landing page fails to convince people to pre-order. One thing that I think is maybe that the release date is too far in the future (end of the year), and that it makes people less inclined to pre-order. Maybe it'll change once I get closer to the release date... It's all a big experiment for me :)

Next week, I'll continue working on part 3; there are tons of subjects to cover.

That's it for today!
