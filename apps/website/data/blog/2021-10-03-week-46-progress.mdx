Hello everyone!

I hope you all had a great week!

My son has finally arrived at home last week. And what a joy it is! I can't take my eyes off of him âœ¨

## Progress
As I imagined, working on Dev Concepts was practically impossible this week. My son needs to wake up every 3 hours, so our nights are rather tiresome at the moment ;-)

But I still managed to finish the new version of the landing page based on the copywriter's input. The new site does a much better job at showing what Dev Concepts is all about and what it includes. I hope that you'll all like it!

I didn't get any news from the designer, but I hope to soon improve the visuals and also have an idea about how we could collaborate for the illustrations of the collection.

## Marketing & Sales
This past week, there were ~100 visitors on the landing page. The spike is due to the announcements I've made on IndieHackers and Twitter.

I'm going to wait a few weeks to see if the new landing page increases the conversion rate. I sure hope it will :)

## What's next
I've decided to take a week or two off as I'm taking care of my family. I'll get back to Dev Concepts asap!

Have a great week!
