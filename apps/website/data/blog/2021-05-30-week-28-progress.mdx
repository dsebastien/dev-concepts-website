Hello there!

To be honest, this has been another low-energy week. There was a lot of stress at home, and I couldn't dedicate nearly enough time to Dev Concepts.

Still, I did continue to collect a few more ideas of concepts to cover in the series. Next week I'll probably spend an hour or two to update the book's mindmap and prioritize a few of those, as the backlog is growing a lot :)

There were ~60 visits on the landing page this week and I sold one more copy of the first volume this week, which felt GREAT. It was the result of me tweeting about the series: https://twitter.com/dSebastien/status/1397920323517894664

People that visit the landing page stay for ~18 seconds. Thus, not much time to convince them. I think that the separate sales pages (landing page being separate from the sales page on Gumroad) might have a negative impact on sales. I think that a re-design of the landing page would really help with the sales.

That's it for today!
Have a great week :)
