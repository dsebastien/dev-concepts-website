Hello there!

Another short update this week.

As planned, I've published the second volume (what clients want) a few days ago: https://gumroad.com/l/DevConcepts-Tome-02-WhatClientsNeed

Not a lot of feedback yet, so I'm hanging there, giving it time, but I've sold a copy, so that's that :)

I've resumed my work on volume 3, writing about microservices and their pros and cons. I've tweeted a bit about that here: https://twitter.com/dSebastien/status/1388419554171367424

Only ~30 visitors on the landing page this week. I need to ramp up the marketing operations ;-)

That's it for today!
