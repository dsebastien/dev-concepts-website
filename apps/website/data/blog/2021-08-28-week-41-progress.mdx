What a week! I thought that I'd have time to work on my projects, but instead, I've spent a lot of time in the hospital. Life is always full of surprises!

It seems that our baby will be arriving sooner than anticipated! We're now rushing to get everything prepared for his arrival, and that leaves little time for other things. Still, I wanted to take a bit of time to check in and say hi to you all!

## Progress
As you can imagine, I was not able to write much this week, so not much that share on that front.

## Marketing & Sales
This week, Claire has started doing customer research for the project. I can't wait to learn about her discoveries & ideas.

This past week, there were ~70 visitors on the landing page.

No new sales this week.

## What's next
Next week, I hope to be able to resume writing, but I'm not sure it'll be possible. My wife is in the hospital right now, and will probably not be out until Wednesday. So, no promises for the coming week.

Have a great week!
