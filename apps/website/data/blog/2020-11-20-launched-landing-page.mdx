After working an unreasonable amount of hours, I've finally published the landing page of the product.

I've tried various approaches (e.g., HubSpot, Mailchimp, etc), but wasn't happy with the results or hit free-tier limitations.

So I did what any crafter would do: craft my own thing. Of course it took me longer and cost me more, but there's also the pleasure of DYI ;-)
