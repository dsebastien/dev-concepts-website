Hey there!

This week I didn't write as much as I wanted to because of personal circumstances, but I did write about 20% of part 3 so far, which is not bad, all in all.

As I said last time, part 3 is about IT Architecture, a domain that I enjoy a lot. I feel like it is often not given all the attention it deserves. People are way more interested in arguing about which frameworks to use. And it's a big mistake, considering how impactful architectural choices can be, while most frameworks can equally help us to achieve our goals.

So far in part 3, I wrote about IT architecture, enterprise applications, talked about the hype cycle, enterprise architecture , and solution architecture. While doing so, I emphasized the focus of each discipline.

Finally, I've started my section about software architecture, which is clearly going to be the largest, and most interested one of this part.

This week I got 45 visits on the landing page, which is still very low. I've got one more pre-order, which I'm really glad about. It's a colleague of mine, and it means a lot to me to feel supported.

There's just a week left for the early-bird price, but people don't seem to notice the book so far. I guess I've still got work to do on the marketing/communication side.

Next week, I'll continue working on part 3; I hope to complete the section about software architecture.

That's it for today!
