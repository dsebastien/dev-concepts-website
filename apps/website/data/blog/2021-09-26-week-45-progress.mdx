Hello everyone!

I hope you all had a great week!

This week has been another whirlwind. My newborn son is still at the hospital right now, but hopefully he should be able to get back home with us tomorrow afternoon. I can't wait ;-)

## Progress
This week I could only spend a few hours here and there. As I imagined, it was complicated to juggle between taking care of everything at home, the kids, school, sports, etc on my own.

I made great progress on the new landing page. The new site should be up in a few days.

I've also met with the designer who should help me improve the visuals of the landing page. She might also help me improve the illustrations of the book, but it really depends on the prices she proposes me. Even if I don't hire her for those illustrations now, I will certainly do it later if the collection starts selling.

## Marketing & Sales
This past week, there were ~40 visitors on the landing page. The main sources were: Twitter, IndieHackers, and Google.

No new sales this week.

## What's next
This week is going to be tough for Dev Concepts. I feel bad because I'd love to give it more energy, but with my son coming back home real soon, I expect to be very very tired ;-)

So no promises for this week. I'll do my best to deploy the new landing page, and I'll get back to writing Volume 3 if I'm done with that.

Have a great week!
