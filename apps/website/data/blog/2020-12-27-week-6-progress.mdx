As planned, I've now started writing the first part of the book, dedicated to the software craft.

The start was slow, as usual, but I've made good progress this week. I've written about 30 pages this week, which is a bit above my weekly goal. I've written about half of this first part, which feels pretty good.

It's going to be hard to keep that rhythm, especially since this is only the first draft, but I'll do my best to keep the pace.

So far, I've also covered about 1/3 of the core advice that I want to share through this chapter (important skills & practical advice section):

* Enjoy solving problems
* Improve your analytical skills
* Be creative and open-minded
* Be organized
* Always Be Curious (ABC)
* Improve continuously
* Build (good) habits

The landing page doesn't have much success so far; I've only had 21 visits in the last 7 days. Clearly, I'll have to get the word out a bit louder next year.

I saw multiple books somewhat similar to mine, albeit much "lighter". It's always hard not to be demotivated, but I'm fighting against the automatic negativity =)

I'm taking a few days off now, so I won't have much to share next week, but I'll get back to it in 2021 ;-)

Best wishes to everyone!
