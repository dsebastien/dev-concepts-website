Hey there!

Great news this week, I've completed the first draft of part 1. It's of course an important milestone, and it feels GREAT.

Part 1 is 95 (!) pages long and full of practical advice about how to become a software crafter. In it, I shared many ideas that I would've loved to be taught but had to discover on my own over the years.

I took a day off to celebrate (ok, I mean about 1 hour off), then immediately started working on the second part.

Part 2 is dedicated to what clients need, which is (sometimes) in opposition with what users think/say that they need.

There was one more pre-order this week (yay!), receiving the Gumroad notifications really feel good :)

importantly one of my first customers agreed to receive early drafts and give me feedback. In exchange, I offered to directly answer questions, meaning that it should be a win-win arrangement: I'll get first-hand, actual feedback, and my customer will get early access to the content, and direct access to "the source". My hope is that remarks/questions that I get will provide an additional feed of ideas to further improve the book. We'll see how that goes!

This week, I've also reworked the landing page a bit, thanks to the feedback I gratefully received from a super friendly Indie Hacker (@chloeekim): https://dev-concepts.dev

Along with those changes, I've also announced the end date for the early-bird price: end of February 2021 (https://twitter.com/dSebastien/status/1352536191699214343). At this point, I'm not sure what I'll do next: either increase the price to 100% or still keep a (lower) price reduction.

I still struggle to gain traction and only got ~100 visits in the last week. I need to make more people aware of the project.

Next week, I'll continue working on part 2. I've estimated the page count to ~35, so I should be done in about two weeks; we'll see how that goes ;-)

That's it for today!
