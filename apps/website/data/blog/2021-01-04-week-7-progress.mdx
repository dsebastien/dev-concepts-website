Holiday season is behind us! Last week, like many of you, I enjoyed a good PAUSE.

It wasn't that easy for me as I really felt an urge to continue working/writing, but I almost succeeded in resisting that urge.

I say almost because I did spend a Saturday morning writing a few sections of the book (woops).

So far, I reached about 60% of the first part of the book, which is pretty darn good. Of course, I'd love to already put the finishing touches to the last drafts, but it's okay. One page at a time!

I looked around, and I really couldn't find another book that covered all of the subjects that I want to cover in mine.

The more I write, and the more I find ideas about things to add. I have to remain careful about scope creep, but I really feel like this is going to be AWESOME, and, I hope, useful for many people.

The way I think about this project is that I want to write a book that I would've loved when coming out of school. I don't target only newbies though; I think that many in the IT industry will find things to learn in it; no matter their personal background.

I try not to look too much at the analytics of the landing page for now because the numbers keep going down. But it's to be expected given how little word of mouth I try to get so far.

An idea that I have in mind is to try and sell the first part of the book as a separate product, just as a test. It pretty much stands on its own, conveys really useful messages for anyone willing to become a software crafter and it probably wouldn't require too much effort to extract it from the rest.

It might give some people interest in the rest of the book, might generate some revenue of its own, etc. I'll see :)

Next week, I plan on hitting 70-80% of that first part.
