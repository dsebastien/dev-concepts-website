Hello there!

"Chaos" continues here in Belgium. My weekly status updates continue to turn into weather reports, this is getting worrisome :p. Floods occurred over here once again...

This week I didn't find energy for Dev Concepts. During the evenings I was really too tired and only managed to sit down and relax. I clearly need a vacation! As I'm juggling between three different jobs, two kids, and helping my pregnant wife, writing Dev Concepts is quite the challenge ;-)

I understand that this update may be disappointing if you're eagerly waiting for me to deliver the Architecture volume, but I'm playing the long game. Rushing things won't help, it would just lower the quality, which is precisely what I'm trying to avoid.

To help improve my writing consistency, I've decided to rearrange my weekly schedule. As of next week, I'll resume my morning writing routine. Instead of trying to write on Tuesday + Thursday evenings and Saturday/Sunday mornings, I'll instead write from Monday to Friday, 5:30 AM to 7:30 AM. With this new schedule, I should be able to move forward more efficiently than in the last weeks, and without interruptions. Children are on vacation, and it's tough to tell them "nope, sorry, Dad won't be there again tonight".

There were ~20 visits on the landing page this past week, and no new sale. Hopefully, I should soon start working with the designer that'll help me improve the landing page. This, combined with the new copy I'm preparing should dramatically improve the quality of the home page, and help better convey the message and value of Dev Concepts. Can't wait to see the result!

See you next week!
